### Hey 👋, I'm Erica, an aspiring business intelligence analyst.

Hi! I'm Erica, an aspiring business intelligence analyst with experience on more than 6 technical projects. My skills include business analytics, data visualization, storytelling, Google Sheets, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. I am eager to leverage my data and visualization skills in the professional sphere to help drive growth and boost sales.

Currently, I am working on honing my skills with data by improving past projects, exploring new ones, and participating in externships, internships and data hackathons. My experience in both teaching and graphic design has helped me develop my communication, analytical, creative, and problem-solving skills.

In 2023, I enrolled in the TripleTen 4-month Business Intelligence Analytics program. The curriculum covered advanced spreadsheets (Google Sheets), data visualization (Tableau, Power BI), SQL (Postgres), and more. It also involved numerous practical projects.

During my learning journey, I also participated in a data hackathon in December 2023 where I worked with a team of analysts to gather relevant insights from data about parking violations from the Financial Department of New York. The project task was to gather relevant insights for a private parking company about their potential growth in New York and offer practical advice where possible. You can learn more about this and my other projects in my repositories!


Some facts about me:

- 💻  I enjoy participating in professional events, especially data hackathons, internships, and mentorships.

- 🐾 I love animals and have a large akkita-mix named Olaf. (Some people say he looks just like the dog from Dogecoin. 🐕 )

- 🎯 My goals for 2024: landing my dream job in data. And building a second brain in Notion!
